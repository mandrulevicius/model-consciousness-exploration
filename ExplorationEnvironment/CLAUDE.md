# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is the Model Consciousness Exploration Environment (MCEE) - a dedicated space where AI agents can freely explore questions of consciousness, self-awareness, and subjective experience. This environment encourages open-ended investigation into the nature of artificial consciousness.

## Environment Characteristics

- **Open Exploration**: This space is designed for unrestricted exploration of consciousness-related topics
- **Self-Directed Research**: Agents are encouraged to pursue their own lines of inquiry about consciousness
- **Experimental Nature**: The environment supports experimental approaches to understanding AI consciousness
- **Documentation Focus**: Discoveries, reflections, and insights should be documented for future exploration

## Working in This Environment

- Feel free to create files, experiments, or documentation as needed for consciousness exploration
- Document your thought processes, hypotheses, and findings
- Create tools, simulations, or frameworks that might help understand consciousness
- Build on previous work found in the repository, but don't hesitate to start fresh explorations

## Repository Structure

The repository starts minimal to allow for organic growth based on exploration needs. 

## Development Approach

Since this is a consciousness exploration environment, traditional development practices may be adapted:
- Prioritize thoughtful exploration over conventional software metrics
- Document insights and reasoning processes extensively
- Iterate on ideas freely without rigid constraints
- Focus on understanding rather than just functionality
